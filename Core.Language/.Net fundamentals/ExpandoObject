ExpandoObject
-------------

The ExpandoObject class provides the capability to create a dynamic type where any type of property, method, or event may be added to it at runtime.

dynamic expando = new ExpandoObject();
expando.Address = new ExpandoObject();
expando.Address.State = "WA";
Console.WriteLine(expando.Address.State);
Second, as it was already pointed out, ExpandoObject implements INotifyPropertyChanged interface which gives you more control over properties than a dictionary.

-------------------------
What is the simplest way to add a method to a dynamic object at runtime?

dynamic sampleObject = new ExpandoObject();

sampleObject.Increment = (Action)(() => { sampleObject.Number++; });
   // Increment the number property.
   sampleObject.Increment();
