What is a memory mapped file and when should it be used? 

A memory-mapped file provides the most efficient way for multiple processes to communicate with each other by using shared memory. Using a memory-mapped file is more efficient than using a socket connection or using an anonymous pipe. A memory-mapped file can also be used to load a large file on disk into memory for processing by multiple processes. A memory mapped file should be used when the most efficient communication between multiple processes is needed.


What functionality does the "using static" statement provide?

using System;
using static System.Console;
class Program
{
static void Main()
   {
      // Console.WriteLine("Hello world!");
      // If the using static statement is removed,
      // then the following line will not compile.
      WriteLine("Hello world!");
   }
}
