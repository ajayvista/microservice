Facade

a facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code. A facade can:

improve the readability and usability of a software library by masking interaction with more complex components behind a single (and often simplified) API
provide a context-specific interface to more generic functionality (complete with context-specific input validation)
serve as a launching point for a broader refactor of monolithic or tightly-coupled systems in favor of more loosely-coupled code

/* Complex parts */

class CPU {
    public void freeze() { ... }
    public void jump(long position) { ... }
    public void execute() { ... }
}

class Memory {
    public void load(long position, byte[] data) { ... }
}

class HardDrive {
    public byte[] read(long lba, int size) { ... }
}

/* Facade */

class ComputerFacade {
    private CPU processor;
    private Memory ram;
    private HardDrive hd;

    public ComputerFacade() {
        this.processor = new CPU();
        this.ram = new Memory();
        this.hd = new HardDrive();
    }

    public void start() {
        processor.freeze();
        ram.load(BOOT_ADDRESS, hd.read(BOOT_SECTOR, SECTOR_SIZE));
        processor.jump(BOOT_ADDRESS);
        processor.execute();
    }
}
